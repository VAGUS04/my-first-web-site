  The dysregulated host response in sepsis is complex, with pathogen-related factors contributing to disease, as well as host-mediated overproduction of endogenous molecules leading to adverse outcomes at each stage of the disease.
  Due to heterogeneity of sepsis, clinical recognition remains challenging, with knowledge gaps in understanding disease mechanisms and viable therapeutic options.
  This Series from eBioMedicine seeks to address knowledge gaps in diagnostics, disease mechanisms and therapeutics of sepsis, and provides forward-looking perspectives from key opinion leaders regarding important unmet needs and challenges that remain in sepsis research.</p>
